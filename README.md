# Pong-ai-browser
Neat ai Pong for browser 

A while back I did a Machine Learning tutorial which used NEAT-AI to train a pong paddle. The training was carried out using python. 

Following training using NEAT algorithms, the AI plays pong to a high standard. 

For the purposes of my portfolio I connected the AI to a JS browser.
